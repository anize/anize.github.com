    Bad news: Terminus's hard drive died
    Date: Mon Apr  9 06:54:29 EDT 2012
    
    Seriously keep calm and carry on. All anize.org mail is now being directed to 
    google. I have a very recent backup of all of the webpages and mysql 
    database.[1]
    
    Please contact dfc to get your username/password for email@anize.org.
    
    I think everyone should have some way of contacting me with some level of 
    trust/authentication; phone, established faebook connection, etc. If you are 
    not so blessed have who ever referred you to anize.org contact me.
    
    Sincerely, 
    
    Douglas F. Calvert
    
    [1] I think the backup did the drive in. terminus was >10 years old so it was 
    bound to happen eventually.
